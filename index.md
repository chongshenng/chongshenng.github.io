Hi! I'm John Ng and I'm an analytical scientist. 

My official title is as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Physics of Fluids group](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/ "Physics of Fluids group") at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, and I specialize in computational physics. By day, I study multiphase fluid physics, for instance [bubbles in a turbulent mixed tank](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.506 "bubbly turbulence") and [evaporating cough droplets in air](https://youtu.be/QiG5-naXkBo "lifetimes of respiratory droplets")). I am also a self-taught data scientist and machine learning enthusiast. I am passionate about building simple tools to learn from data. All of my research is generated from numerical simulations conducted on supercomputers around Europe. So, you can say that it is in my nature to handle and tease insights from large datasets!

## Interests
I'm actively contributing to the following research areas:
1. Turbulent multiphase flows (relevant to pollutant dispersion in the oceans and in the atmosphere).
2. Natural convection (relevant to sustainable energy usage for heat dispersion in buildings, bush fire predictions).
3. Bubbly drag reduction (relevant for developing efficient marine transport vehicles).
4. Computational fluid dynamics
5. Parallelised high-performance computing
6. Immersed boundary methods
7. Phase field methods

I am also working on projects utilizing deep learning and natural language processing toolkits.
