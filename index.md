Hi! I'm Chong Shen and I'm an analytical scientist. 

I'm a post-doctoral researcher in the field of computational physics at the [Physics of Fluids group](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/) at the University of Twente. By day, I study multiphase fluid physics ([bubbles in water](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.506), [breath droplets in air](https://youtu.be/QiG5-naXkBo)). I am also a self-taught developer, data scientist and machine learning enthusiast. I am passionate about building simple tools to learn from data. All of my research is generated from numerical simulations conducted on supercomputers around Europe. So, you can say that it is in my nature to handle big datasets!

## Interests
I am currently interested and researching on:
1. Deep learning and artificial intelligence
2. Data-centric workflows

In the past 8 years, I've contributed to the following research areas:
1. Applied and engineering mathematics
2. Computational fluid dynamics
3. Turbulent multiphase flows (pollutant dispersion, natural convection, turbulent boundary layers)
4. Parallelised high-performance computing
5. Immersed boundary methods
