Hi! I'm Chong Shen and you can ask me anything. I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Physics of Fluids group at the University of Twente. I am also a self-taught developer, data scientist and machine learning enthusiast. My background is in computational physics, which you can read about here. I am passionate about learning from data. By day, I am a postdoc researcher looking into multiphase fluid physics (bubbles in water). All of my research is generated from large numerical simulations conducted on supercomputers around Europe. So, you can say that it is in my nature to handle big datasets!

If you've any questions, feel free to ask!

## Interests
I am current interested and learning about:
1. Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence
2. Data-centric workflows


In the past 8 years, my research interests involve the fields of:
1. Applied and engineering mathematics
2. Computational fluid dynamics
3. Turbulent multiphase flows (pollutant dispersion, natural convection, turbulent boundary layers)
4. Parallelised high-performance computing
5. Immersed boundary methods
