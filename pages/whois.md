Hi! I'm Chong Shen and you can ask me anything. I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Physics of Fluids group at the University of Twente. I am also a self-taught data scientist and machine learning enthusiast. My background is in computational physics, which you can read about here. I am passionate about learning from data. By day, I am a postdoc researcher looking into multiphase fluid physics (bubbles in water). All of my research is generated from large numerical simulations conducted on supercomputers around Europe. So, you can say that it is in my nature to handle big datasets!
